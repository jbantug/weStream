For example, if you made a video about League of Legends, use the League of Legends Play Now link. Or, use a Play Now link from another MOBA, like Smashmuck Champions or Dota 2.

Several game publishers complained to us about low-quality conversions which happens if people don't know what to expect after clicking a Play Now link.

It is not good to just get conversions. Game publishers want conversions from people genuinely interested to play their games!

Ultimately, the publishers tell us which of our partners are driving good quality traffic, and which are driving bad quality. If any partner drives only bad quality traffic, we have to block their account to maintain our good reputation with publishers.

Bottom line: Do not add random Play Now links beneath your videos!

For example, do not add a League of Legends Play Now link beneath a video about The Walking Dead or a video about cats.
