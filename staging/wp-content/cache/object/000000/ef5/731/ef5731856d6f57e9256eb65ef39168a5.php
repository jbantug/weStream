The move comes as a shock to many within the WordPress community, including me. WPDaily was spearheaded by John Saddington, leader of the development team <a title="http://8bit.io" href="http://8bit.io">8Bit</a> and project manager of <a title="http://pressgr.am/" href="http://pressgr.am/">PressGram</a>. While no direct cause of the shutdown was given, John noted that while the site achieved a variety of goals, it did not achieve the larger global goals and strategy of their organization at the present time.</p>
<blockquote><p>We achieved every single goal and metric that we had set out to accomplish (and then some) in this glorious experiment and so we consider it a ‚Äúsuccess.‚Äù But, it did not achieve the much larger global goals and strategy of our organization at this present time.</p></blockquote>
<p>One thing I can confirm is that criticism and negative reactions to some of their published content was definitely not a reason for the shutdown. I give John a lot of credit for everything he did with WPDaily. The man was a publishing machine and if you blinked, you missed a ton of content. I occasionally joked that John published so much content that he was the reason infinite scroll was invented. Everywhere I looked, I saw John Saddington with the first comment on posts. This just shows how much he was on the ball with information. I know from experience that the only way John could accomplish what he did with WPDaily involved ridiculously long hours, lots of typing, living within the inbox, and juggling his time with reviewing products and just being in touch with people. For anyone that thinks running a community news type website is easy, you&#8217;re wrong. It&#8217;s very difficult. It requires lots of time reading, communicating, piecing together stories, managing the conversations that take place and a host of other responsibilities. This is why I continue to think that if you don&#8217;t have a primary source of funding, that creating a site like WPDaily or WPTavern just isn&#8217;t worth it in the long run.</p>
<p>However, the shutdown of WPDaily stirred up the conversation again around WordPress news sites and how they can be sustainable. According to one individual, the curation of WordPress content can not be achieved by 1 person or 10 but rather, <a title="https://twitter.com/wptavern/status/355084349428871169" href="https://twitter.com/wptavern/status/355084349428871169">should be an automated process</a>. Then, you could charge access to the site as it would do all of the filtering for you. Hard to say if that idea would take off but the site I have in mind that could potentially make this work is <a title="http://poststat.us/" href="http://poststat.us/">PostStat.us</a>. Brian Krogsgard has <a title="https://twitter.com/Krogsgard/status/355088909039968256" href="https://twitter.com/Krogsgard/status/355088909039968256">stated on Twitter</a> that he has a few tricks up his sleeve to monetize the site but we will have to wait until they are implemented to find out what they are.</p>
<p>I want to personally say to John Saddington that I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors and especially with PressGram. At the same time however, I make a formal request that you highly consider leaving the content archived somewhere for reference material or you either sell, or provide the archive to someone who is more concerned with the historical significance of the content than any other agenda.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I want to thank the individuals who suggested to others that they can use WPTavern to get their fix for WordPress information. However, WPTavern can not and will not be a direct replacement for WPDaily. Both sites contain their own unique flavors, takes on various topics that come up in the community.</p>

I was able to watch a one hour introduction video presented by one of the core developers of Exchange and my initial impression is <strong>wow</strong>. Based on what I&#8217;ve seen, they have done a great job with focusing on simplicity. One of the coolest aspects of their plugin is the modularity of it. </p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/iThemesExchangeFeatures.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/iThemesExchangeFeatures.jpg?resize=500%2C271" alt="Exchange Modularity" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7807" /></a></p>
<p>You can enable/disable specific functionality so that your site only loads what is enabled. One of the other creative aspects behind Exchange is the ability to use it to invoice clients. For example, you can create an invoice which will be a product page, hide that product page from the store, send the client a link to that product page and once they pay, they get a link to a downloadable file which is a PDF with PAID stamped onto the invoice. The platform has over 300 different functions and will sport a hefty theme API. </p>
<p>Marcus Couch will be taking an in-depth look at Exchange and he&#8217;ll give you his thoughts within the next week or two. Until then, <a href="http://ithemes.com/exchange-download.php" title="http://ithemes.com/exchange-download.php">download Exchange</a> as it&#8217;s free and give it a test run.

It&#8217;s to celebrate their fourth birthday (Happy birthday by the way) but there is also a very beneficial catch to this particular giveaway. For every dollar donated to the cause, WPBeginner founder Syed Balkhi will match that amount up to $25,000. So why has Syed decided to help build a school? According to a <a href="http://fundraise.pencilsofpromise.org/fundraise?fcid=249743" title="http://fundraise.pencilsofpromise.org/fundraise?fcid=249743">post on PencilsOfPromise.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are currently more than 61 million children without access to education, and together we can do something about it. Education is a cause that&#8217;s truly important to me, so I&#8217;m excited to join the Pencils of Promise movement that empowers lives around the world by building schools for children in need.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time this article was published, $1,791 of $25,000 has been raised with 28 donations. The giveaway ends in four days, 11 hours. </p>

Remember to always test new plugins on a staging or development site first so that you do not risk data loss, conflicts with other plugins or even worse, complete shutdown. Be smart and back up everything before you go to a live site. OK, let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/inline-navi/screenshot-1.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft" alt="Inline Navi WordPress Plugin" src="http://i0.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/inline-navi/screenshot-1.png?resize=215%2C65" /></a><a title="Inline Navi" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/inline-navi/" target="_blank">Inline Navi</a> is a different take on the carious &#8220;post tab&#8221; plugin variants that are available. This plugin uses child pages to populate the content of the tabs. This gives a lot of versatility over some of the other &#8220;tab&#8221; plugins out there. First, you get to use the power of a full post editor to create your tab content. This allows you the opportunity to add any other shortcode or plugin output to be used within the context of the tab content. Other plugins out there do only basic html markup or plain text. I like the functionality. Worth checking out.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/plugins/facebook-pixel-conversions-for-wp/screenshot-1.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft" alt="Facebook Pixel Conversions for WordPress" src="http://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/plugins/facebook-pixel-conversions-for-wp/screenshot-1.jpg?resize=233%2C114" /></a><a title="Facebook Pixel Conversions for WordPress" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/facebook-pixel-conversions-for-wp/" target="_blank">Facebook Pixel Conversions</a> for WordPress helps you to track the conversions and sales that come from Facebook ads and social referrals. This is important to use beyond what you might already depend on, which could be Webmaster Tools or other tracking means. This works by inserting the required <a title="Facebook Pixel Information" href="https://www.facebook.com/help/435189689870514/" target="_blank">Facebook Conversion Tracking Pixel</a> JavaScript directly into each post, allowing you unique tracking on an individual post basis. If you or a client is using Facebook advertising to funnel to a WordPress based site or landing page, you&#8217;ll want to implement this method. The more data you have regarding the advertising spend of you or your client, the better. I&#8217;ve seen merchants and offers that advertise on Facebook who convert quite well with WordPress sites. This plugin could increase the conversions even further when used in conjunction with A/B testing plugins such as ones mentioned last week.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/mg-webtrends-graphs/assets/screenshot-4.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft" alt="MG Webtrends Graphs" src="http://i1.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/mg-webtrends-graphs/assets/screenshot-4.png?resize=183%2C113" /></a><a title="MG Webtrends Graphs" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/mg-webtrends-graphs/" target="_blank">MG Webtrends Graphs</a> allows you to insert Google Trends data to your posts or on the fly. It works by embedding a shortcode with one or more keywords to &#8220;trend&#8221; in the graphic. For example, [mgtrends q="+windows,+Linux, +mac"] gives you a trending graph for Windows, Linux and Mac all in a comparison line graph. This is done in relative real-time, so it self updates the graphic within your content as time goes on. The load time was a bit of a drag on my testing site, but that&#8217;s to be expected with multi-variant external call-outs to Google. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d have a specific use for it on any of my sites, but I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a good use for something like this out there somewhere! Perhaps a celebrity trend monitoring site? Let me know if you come up with any ideas for usage. I&#8217;d be interested to hear some of your ideas for how trends can be used within a WordPress site or subsequent content.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/new-google-plus-badge-widget/screenshot-1.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft" alt="New Google Plus Badge Widget" src="http://i1.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/new-google-plus-badge-widget/screenshot-1.png?resize=143%2C121" /></a><a title="New Google Plus Badge Widget" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/new-google-plus-badge-widget/" target="_blank">New Google Plus Badge Widget</a> lets you show off the newest Google+ badge scheme on your WordPress site, which includes a photo tile mosaic, along with a profile picture, name, link, description, follow button and follower count. Typically you would need to insert the badge via JavaScript code embed. Using this plugin, you can use the badge with minimal code input. It was easy to set up with my standard G+ user URL and was easily stylized via CSS with the available CSS panel. It&#8217;s funny how many different badge plugin incarnations there have been throughout the last decade. For now though, this is the latest and greatest when displaying your G+ profile.</p>
<p><a title="Invoice King Pro" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/invoice-king-pro/" target="_blank">Invoice King Pro</a> helps you to send out invoices and estimates to clients within your WordPress installation. This is especially intriguing to me as I already spend $40 a month on FreshBooks to handle my client invoicing and cost estimates. IKP features different &#8220;themes&#8221; for each invoice and estimateas which vary in look and feel when printed. Custom themes have been pre-configured and are available as add-ons to the plugin for an additional $5 per &#8220;theme&#8221;. You begin your setup process by adding all of the custom fields that&nbsp;you intend to use in the invoicing process. Once complete, you enter your client contact information into the system and start the billing! When you have an invoice or estimate to send, it emails to your client the PDF document automatically with the pre-defined mail credentials and reply-to that you set up. So if your client replies to the invoice, it goes straight into your inbox. Once payment is made from the client, you can easily mark the invoice paid and fire off a receipt to the client in the same manner. While this seems to be a robust plugin on the surface, there are a lot of opportunities for improvement. A payment gateway or direct link to PayPal with forwarding invoice information would be an outstanding addition. There is still a long way to go to match FreshBooks or similar services, but this is a really great, bold attempt at cracking the glass by using WordPress. How about modding this so we can all install it on our client&#8217;s web sites and it invoices it from there? Perhaps add a countdown timer to shutting down the site if the invoice isn&#8217;t paid? LOL. I&#8217;m kidding, right?</p>

This app store would not have to operate under the same guidelines as the official WordPress repositories and would feature the vast assortment of commercial options available. <a title="http://wpappstore.com/" href="http://wpappstore.com/">WP App Store</a> is one such site. The site is just over one year old so I thought I&#8217;d get in touch with Brad Touesnard to see how the past year has been and what their plans are for 2013.</p>
<p><strong>What was the motivation behind launching the WordPress App Store considering WPPlugins was the first of its kind?</strong></p>
<p>I thought it would be really awesome to have all the best themes and plugins in one place and be able to click once to buy and install. No downloading and uploading zips. I mean, everyone uses the WordPress.org repo and everyone loves how easy it is to install a theme or plugin. I wanted to offer the same simplicity for commercial themes and plugins, but only the best.</p>
<p><a title="http://wpplugins.com/" href="http://wpplugins.com/">wpplugins.com</a> doesn&#8217;t have the best themes and plugins. All of the big brands are missing. When I started this project, the first thing I did was get the big guys on-board. If I hadn&#8217;t been able to do that, it would have been a non-starter.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPAppStoreVendors.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7758" alt="WP App Store Vendors" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPAppStoreVendors.jpg?resize=500%2C205" /></a></p>
<p><strong>How many people are involved with this project?</strong></p>
<p>There are four people involved with this project: <a title="http://wpappstore.com/about/" href="http://wpappstore.com/about/">http://wpappstore.com/about/</a></p>
<p><strong>Was the decision to support only GPL licensed products made before the launch or was there any discussion of listing everything?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been 100% GPL since day one. I don&#8217;t see why you would go any other route.</p>
<p><strong>Can you describe how the App Store works?</strong></p>
<p>WP App Store is a WordPress plugin that you install into your WordPress dashboard. Then you can browse themes and plugins that we have in our marketplace from your WordPress dashboard. When you find something you like, you click <strong>Buy &amp; Install</strong> and once you enter your payment details, your theme or plugin is installed automatically.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPAppStoreThemes.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7759" alt="WP App Store Themes" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPAppStoreThemes.jpg?resize=500%2C387" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The site is only a year old. What types of numbers are you seeing stat wise and financially? Secondly, what&#8217;s the adoption rate been like? Are you noticing a continued interest or influx of new users?</strong></p>
<p>I prefer not to share sales or traffic figures, but just to say that currently monthly revenue not sustainable and that few people have installed the plugin. The fact that they have to download it from our website (<em>the plugin is not allowed in the WordPress.org repo</em>) and upload it to your WordPress install is a huge barrier for our customers. We had a few strategies to make it much easier for people to install the plugin, but unfortunately none of them panned out. After talking to customers, I also found out that most of them are happier purchasing directly from vendors and only come to WP App Store to discover new themes or plugins.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPAppStorePlugins.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7760" alt="WP App Store Plugins" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPAppStorePlugins.jpg?resize=500%2C337" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What lessons have you learned from this experience?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned that even though a business idea seems like a sure thing and everyone is telling you it&#8217;s a great idea you should still talk to customers first. Always make sure that you&#8217;re solving a problem that people need solved badly enough that they&#8217;re willing to open their wallet for you.</p>
<p><strong>Other WordPress based app stores have come and gone. How can the WordPress App Store stay in business for the long haul?</strong></p>
<p>We need to switch to a more traditional marketplace and start driving sales. We need to continue curating our product listing and add new products every month to keep customers coming back.</p>
<p><strong>If the store were to shut down, would users be able to download their purchases and take those with them?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, in fact almost all of our vendors have integrated our postback API into their system and when a sale occurs, they create a user account and register the purchase in their own system as well. So almost all of our customers should actually have an account at each vendor.</p>
<p><strong>What excites you about this project?</strong></p>
<p>I think a marketplace where you can find all the best themes and plugins for WordPress is exciting. It&#8217;s audacious to say &#8220;the best themes and plugins&#8221;, but I like that it&#8217;s a clear mission statement.</p>
<p><strong>What can we look forward to in year number two?</strong></p>
<p>As of (July 6), you can now purchase products from the website. We will be working on a major overhaul of the website this summer and hope to drastically improve the shopping experience.</p>

Here in Southern California we like to have fun and this past weekend was no exception. Fun for me though, is taking some quality time to hit the WordPress Plugin Repository and check out the newest plugins to hit the street. I&#8217;m happy to bring you another edition of The Daily Plugin where we highlight some of the newest and most recently updated plugins available for WordPress. Remember to always test these plugins on a duplicate development or staging site to mitigate your risk of anything going wrong with a fully live site. With that being said, let&#8217;s all get plugged in!</p>

As we have talked about previously with other revision archive tools, it&#8217;s fantastic to be able to reference older changes to WordPress, especially for clients who frequently change opinions about site colors, layouts, etc during the design phase. It&#8217;s always great to have a degree of rollback control with anything, especially as something as critical as theme design options.</p>

As one who originally began my WordPress journey over 8 years ago BECAUSE of the RSS/Podcasting capabilities, I welcome all plugins that allow crafting of how the RSS feed is shaped. This plugin works easily by adding the ID numbers of one or more categories to exclude from publishing in the main RSS feed. Another great plugin by Flourish Pixel.</p>

Instead, this plugin enables a new text input box in each individual post&#8217;s content editor.&nbsp; This would let you customize the call to action for prompting your viewers to make a post. Anything from &#8220;Do you think this person is GUILTY? Why or Why Not?&#8221; to &#8220;Are you experiencing problems with your Gadget 2001 as well? Let us Know!&#8221;. Anything you want. It&#8217;s all customized per post to say whatever you want.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/youtube-analytics/assets/screenshot-2.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft" alt="YouTube Analytics Dashboard" src="http://i0.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/youtube-analytics/assets/screenshot-2.png?resize=213%2C124" /></a><a title="YouTube Analytics Dashboard" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/youtube-analytics/" target="_blank">YouTube Analytics Dashboard</a> allows you to view your YouTube video analytic views and statistics right in your WordPress dashboard. This helps to prevent going back and forth to your YouTube account and would also allow you the means to use this for clients. Permitting more data in the dashboard gives your client the reinforcement that their WordPress based domain is a web property and WordPress can be the &#8220;transparency conduit&#8221; for all other social arms out there, including YouTube. It also allows you to have access restrictions based on user role, so if you only want admins to see the data, it&#8217;s completely configurable with just a simple drop down. I love the direction that this plugin is going in and welcome more statistical and analytical based plugins from other developers to follow in the same manner. The more we can use the user dashboard to display external information, the better.</p>

In other words, people can scroll through a Google map that is tagged with pins. Each pin is defined by placing a location tag in each post. The editor allows you to enter in a location relevant to a category, such as identifying a news item about a particular country or city. The viewer would then be able to navigate around a map and see how many stories are listed in each area. This could also be listed in this manner for business purposes to show pages from different locations or franchise info for each store. You would create a new post or page the location would populate based on the category. The map would then highlight exactly where each post is associated and grouped. Very nice technical capabilities with very little user input required. It would be nicer to be able to individually tag the posts and pages themselves rather than having to associate with a category all the time. Then you could associate individual addresses with individual posts.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be back on tomorrow with another edition of The Daily Plugin, scouting out the newest rookies in the game to see if they are good enough to make the cut for YOUR team of preferred plugins. Be sure to say hello on Twitter <a title="Marcus Couch on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/marcuscouch">@marcuscouch</a> and leave your comments, suggestions and admiration notes about any of the plugins mentioned right on <a title="The Daily Plugin for 7-8-2013" href="http://www.wptavern.com/podcast-dedicated-to-all-things-plugins">WPTavern</a>.</p>

<p>The thing that&#8217;s been bugging me most over the last few months is how poorly my <a href="http://alexking.org/projects">projects page</a> reflects the projects I&#8217;m actually working on. I&#8217;ve decided to try to solve this with three changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m creating a &#8220;projects&#8221; taxonomy to better group posts that relate to a given project.</li>
<li>I intend to write a bit more about the stuff I&#8217;m working on.</li>
<li>My projects page will be powered by the content on this site instead of by static content that I forget to update.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be converting a few &#8220;threads&#8221; and a few &#8220;categories&#8221; to &#8220;projects&#8221;, and I&#8217;ve gone through my content and selected the posts that need to be attached to each project. I&#8217;m also borrowing the presentation from my threads plugin for projects, as I believe the timeline is a good way to show that a project is active or dormant.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post the scripts on GitHub when they are tested and solid, this type of moving and re-categorizing content is something I expect more people will want to do as their content grows and evolves.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 08 Jul 2013 01:25:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Alex";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

I sent the following email to 1&amp;1 sales department to figure out why it&#8217;s set-up that way.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/11OneClickInstaller.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7718" alt="One And One Installer" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/11OneClickInstaller.jpg?resize=484%2C315" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>If I understand this correctly, the one click installer for WordPress is not able to be auto-upgraded, correct? If this is the case, why bother having that feature to begin with? It seems to me that is an irresponsible thing for a webhost to do. The ease of installation is a great thing but if it can not be auto-upgraded when a new version of WordPress is released, it makes the ease of installation a moot point. Could someone from 1&amp;1 explain to me why the one click installer for WordPress is set up in this way?</p></blockquote>
<p>Their response:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Customer,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us.</p>
<p>Please be informed that for security reasons, the following changes and modifications are not possible in Click &amp; Build applications. Installation of new templates, new plugins, new modules, new components, or new language packages are not allowed as well as insertion of custom source code (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or PHP) in preinstalled templates or other places in Click &amp; Build applications.</p>
<p>However, you can install WordPress manually, just refer to the link below for the steps.</p></blockquote>
<p>The email goes on to list each step in the manual installation process. So not only can you not upgrade WordPress if it&#8217;s installed via their application installer, but you can&#8217;t install themes, plugins, language packs, or the insertion of code. It&#8217;s as if you&#8217;re using a locked down version of WordPress.com. How many people stick with the default theme, default plugins, etc and don&#8217;t plan on adding anything to WordPress? Slim to none is my guess. Their particular setup has been like this <a title="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-exactly-do-i-edit?replies=20#post-524050" href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-exactly-do-i-edit?replies=20#post-524050">for over 6 years and counting</a>. I&#8217;d love to see some figures from them on how many people are using their Quick Application installer specifically for WordPress.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to say WordPress is easy to install and for someone who is tech literate, it is. However, after browsing the WordPress.org support forums and seeing so many people struggling to FTP this and MySQL that, it&#8217;s hard to say it&#8217;s easy to install. That&#8217;s why the one click installers were invented, they were supposed to lift the burden of being tech literate to get a WordPress site up and going but by using the click and build installer from 1&amp;1, users are setting themselves up for disaster with more pain and struggles that are unnecessary.</p>
<p>My advice is to stay away from any of these one click installers and go through the process of manually setting up WordPress. It&#8217;s worth learning in the long run. For tips on installing, I highly recommend the following Codex article, <a title="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress">Installing WordPress</a>. For the visual learners, this presentation from WordCamp Phoenix 2013 does a great job explaining how to install WordPress in different ways. <a title="https://speakerdeck.com/sereedmedia/installing-wordpress-wordcampphx" href="https://speakerdeck.com/sereedmedia/installing-wordpress-wordcampphx">These are the slides</a> that go with the presentation.</p>
<div class="aligncenter"></div>
<p>I know Fantastico has the ability to install WordPress without the need of FTP or database credentials but does it carry the same limitations? I sure hope what 1&amp;1 provides is not considered the industry standard for quick installations.</p>

The only configuration that is necessary for BruteProtect is to apply a free API key to communicate with the service. If you&#8217;re using the <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts/">Limit Login Attempts</a> plugin to block unsuccessful login attempts, you&#8217;ll need to disable it as there is no need to run both plugins. The idea behind BruteProtect is very similar to how Akismet operates. I got in touch with Sam Hotchkiss, one of the lead developers behind the plugin/service to describe how it works.</p>
<blockquote><p>BruteProtect is sort of like Akismet, but for your WP login&#8211; we track failed logins across a large number of WordPress sites, then analyze that data to find patterns and identify attack bots. &nbsp;The larger our installed base, the more data we have to work with&#8211; this results in more complete protection for site owners and fewer false positives. &nbsp;To date, we&#8217;ve blocked over 1.3 million malicious login attempts from over 131,000 IP addresses.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/BruteProtectInAction.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/BruteProtectInAction.jpg?resize=500%2C185" alt="BruteProtectInAction" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7700" /></a></p>
<p>The more people that use BruteProtect, the better protected its users are. The blocking and logging happens behind the scenes. However, there is a new dashboard widget that is created that shows off the number of blocked login attempts and just within the time span of writing this review, it&#8217;s blocked 72 of them. Sam has told me that they are working on big updates that will be available shortly.</p>
<p>BruteProtect comes from the same folks that are behind <a title="https://quickforget.com/" href="https://quickforget.com/">QuickForget.com</a>. QuickForget gives you a secure way to send passwords, credit card numbers, SSNs, etc.</p>

As you can see by the most recent posting yesterday, there are sometimes bad plugins that make it through the cracks for a day or so before the community watch takes over and removes the offender.¬† Don&#8217;t take the risk of losing your hard work and data by installing a plugin that is untested with your unique installation and plugin set. Learn from MY past mistakes. Backup, test, repeat. The following plugins are not endorsements, recommendations or ratings but a mere spoon-sized taste of the latest plugins from the WordPress Plugin Repository. OK, let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>
<p><a title="WP Revisions Control" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-revisions-control/" target="_blank">WP Revisions Control</a> helps to limit the revision versions that are stored within each WordPress post or page. When installed and activated, this plugin has settings available in the Settings&gt;Writing configuration page. From that point you will set the maximum amount of revisions that are kept for each post type. Plugin author <a title="Erick Hitter WordPress Profile" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/ethitter/" target="_blank">Erick Hitter</a> foresaw a need for this plugin after revisions started being archived back in WordPress version 3.6. While the new post revision archive was a good advancement, there was no limitation as to how many revisions it capped in the database, which could increase load time and decrease overall site performance. By using an application such as this, you can limit the unwanted clutter that normally occurs when you are editing the same post on a frequent basis. From a personal perspective, I limit my post revision archive count to five. This allows me the opportunity to look back and alter without clogging up my entire database as a result.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/contact-us-page-contact-people/assets/screenshot-1.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignright" alt="Contact Us Page Contact People" src="http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/contact-us-page-contact-people/assets/screenshot-1.jpg?resize=200%2C231" /></a><a title="Contact Us Contact People WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-us-page-contact-people/" target="_blank">Contact Us Page &#8211; Contact People</a> is a very intense plugin by <a title="Steve Truman WordPress User Profile" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/a3rev/" target="_blank">Steve Truman</a> at A3 Revolution Software for displaying the contact information of people or fixed business locations from around the world. It does so with a very intuitive contact &#8220;blocks&#8221; like feature that is displayed on a grid overlay. Both individuals and departments can be featured as well as overall companies. Google maps are optional add-ins that can be enabled to show the main location and pins of each individual profile location on a map. You have the option to show as little or as much as you&#8217;d like in each individual profile. Another nice feature is that the plugin allows for direct e-mail submission from site visitors to each contact profile. It does so without displaying an e-mail address online, helping to prevent spam. It is also mobile optimized and can be design modified from a single column to a five column layout.</p>
<p><a title="Date Tool WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/date-tool/" target="_blank">Date Tool</a> helps to insert date based shortcodes into your content. It&#8217;s great for posts where you frequently have to edit and change the date within the content month after month or year after year. This plugin allows you to set it and forget it, self updating your content by inserting the current chronological variable for you. For example, <strong>Shortcode:</strong> [datetool_current format="Y"] <strong>Output:</strong> 2013 (or what the current year is). It works on dates, day of the month and a lot of other fields to help you prevent the monthly update grind where you have to change dates or months. Remember though, this only changes the content, not the meta data or post titles. You&#8217;ll still have to manually change those items.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/colored-admin-post-list/screenshot-1.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignright" alt="Colored Admin Post List" src="http://i2.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/colored-admin-post-list/screenshot-1.png?resize=343%2C175" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Colored Admin Post List WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/colored-admin-post-list/" target="_blank">Colored Admin Post List</a> is a simple yet effective method to visually separate post statuses simply by looking at the color. When enabled, you can select a custom color background for draft, future, pending, private and published posts. Once you have your colors set, your posts will all be color-coded for easy sorting or to bring to your attention any older content items that you may have forgotten to finish that are still in draft or private mode. I love coloring the most important cells of my Excel spreadsheets, so this plugin is the next best thing for me in WordPress posts list form!</p>
<p><a title="Related Articles By Tag WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/related-articles-by-tag/" target="_blank">Related Articles by Tag</a> may help to fill a particular gap in the site that I own simply based on its namesake. Often when you run a website that is heavily based on the locations and the subsequent location tags, you often find a very large hole when it comes to displaying any sort of related posts functionality. For this particular site I have common tags only when it comes to city name variants. Using a plugin like this would allow me to insert a short code at the bottom of my city-based (or any subject) article that would reference other matching tags in the series without having to try and create categories for every city in the process to get the same functionality. This is a nice plugin for those who use the tag functionality in organized ways.</p>
<p>Join us again tomorrow as we give you another fine set of plugins to check out. As always you can follow me on Twitter <a title="Marcus Couch on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/marcuscouch">@marcuscouch</a> or leave your feedback here on <a title="The Daily Plugin for 7-3-2013" href="http://www.wptavern.com/the-daily-plugin-for-7-3-2013">WPTavern</a>.

<p>WPShout has <a title="http://wpshout.com/wordpress-hosting-review-2013/" href="http://wpshout.com/wordpress-hosting-review-2013/">announced the return</a> of their webhosting review for 2013. Unlike other hosting reviews, this one contains no affiliate links and has user submitted data.</p>
<blockquote><p>It‚Äôs over two years since the inaugural Hosting Review, and it‚Äôs now time to update the results with some fresh data. A lot has changed in the last two years: managed hosting is now all the range, the cost of basic shared hosting has fallen and some innovative solutions have popped up to power enterprise-level hosting.</p>
<p>The idea here is simple. Below you‚Äôll find a survey in which you can fill in some details about your host(s). I‚Äôll then collate all that data into a set of recommendations which will be published here on Shout. Collectively, we can create a community and data driven review of the best WordPress hosts.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the first run in 2011 had over 250 responses, the goal is to push that amount even higher. The more people who truthfully respond to this survey, the better the data will be for everyone. The survey will be open until July 14th where the responses will be tabulated and shared with the public. It will be interesting to see how many results this year will be from folks on managed WordPress hosting accounts such as WPEngine or DreamPress.</p>

<blockquote><p>Long-term, I think that comments are the most crucial interaction point for blogs, and an area that deserves a lot of investment and innovation. Comments really haven‚Äôt changed in a decade, and it‚Äôs time to spice things up a little &#8211; Matt Mullenweg, <a title="http://ma.tt/2008/09/intense-debate-goes-automattic/" href="http://ma.tt/2008/09/intense-debate-goes-automattic/">in a blog post about IntenseDebate</a></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/intensedebatelogo.png" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/intensedebatelogo.png?resize=189%2C43" alt="IntenseDebate Logo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2326" /></a></p>
<p>I‚Äôm seeing more and more blogs opt for alternative commenting solutions. Good data is hard to come by in this area, but the modern top choice appears to be Disqus, by a pretty large margin. I‚Äôve noticed quite a few Facebook Comments too, and countless more custom solutions.</p>
<p><a title="http://disqus.com/" href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> is powerful, but much too closed down for my taste and it doesn‚Äôt give you more than comments. They just made an existing feature a bit easier to use, at the cost of control &amp; ownership (<em>a trade that a frightening amount of people seem only too happy to make these days</em>). They didn‚Äôt take comments further, like Matt envisioned. But others have.</p>
<h2>Forum-powered Comments</h2>
<p>Power charging your comments with dedicated forum backends. Now there‚Äôs an <em>evolution</em> of comments if I ever saw one. When done right, every blog post has the potential to spawn several new conversations, branched out from the same seed. This new trend is gaining a lot of traction, and at the forefront you‚Äôll find <a title="http://vanillaforums.org/" href="http://vanillaforums.org/">Vanilla Forums</a> and <a title="http://www.discourse.org/" href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>. Here‚Äôs the kicker:</p>
<p>They both work great with WordPress. Each of these forum packages offers an official WordPress plugin that lets you seamlessly replace your default comments with a slick, forum-powered comments section. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><a title="http://9to5mac.com/" href="http://9to5mac.com/">http://9to5mac.com/</a> &#8211; Vanilla<br />
<a title="http://penny-arcade.com/report/" href="http://penny-arcade.com/report/">http://penny-arcade.com/report/</a> &#8211; Vanilla<br />
<a title="http://www.howtogeek.com/" href="http://www.howtogeek.com/">http://www.howtogeek.com/</a> &#8211; Discourse<br />
<a title="http://boingboing.net/" href="http://boingboing.net/">http://boingboing.net/</a> &#8211; Discourse</p>
<h2>So What Is WordPress‚Äô Answer? It Was Supposed To Be IntenseDebate</h2>
<blockquote><p>We were early in the space with investing in Akismet to solve the spam problem, but now I think the real growth opportunities are in the user interaction and social features across comments. There is a huge opportunity to increase the traffic and engagement of blogs significantly &#8211; Matt Mullenweg, <a title="http://ma.tt/2008/09/intense-debate-goes-automattic/" href="http://ma.tt/2008/09/intense-debate-goes-automattic/">still in a blog post about IntenseDebate</a></p></blockquote>
<p><a title="http://www.intensedebate.com/" href="http://www.intensedebate.com/">IntenseDebate.com</a> lists 6 sites using their service. 2 of them have since moved on to Disqus (<a title="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/06/30/Sarah-Palin-Gettysburg#disqus_thread" href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/06/30/Sarah-Palin-Gettysburg#disqus_thread">breitbart.com</a>) and Facebook Comments (<a title="http://www.techstars.com/video-exclusively-on-the-next-web-startup-stories-sendgrid/" href="http://www.techstars.com/video-exclusively-on-the-next-web-startup-stories-sendgrid/">techstars.com</a>) respectively. Again, solid data is hard to come by, but you don‚Äôt need to <a title="http://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=disqus#q=disqus%2C%20intensedebate&cmpt=q" href="http://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=disqus#q=disqus%2C%20intensedebate&cmpt=q">look at numbers</a> to realize that Disqus left IntenseDebate in the dust a long time ago.</p>
<p>Automattic and WordPress as a whole have failed to seize this opportunity. Amazingly enough, there‚Äôs still time to make a play in the comments ecosystem. I propose that play to be <a title="http://bbpress.org/" href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a>.</p>
<p>Imagine discuss.wordpress.com, the hosted version of bbPress. But it wouldn‚Äôt host forums per-se. It would exclusively host blog comments, and branching discussions thereof. Just like you can find popular new blogs on wordpress.com, here you would discover trending discussions, emerged from blog posts. Using a plugin (JetPack reluctantly comes to mind) even self-hosted blogs (as well as blogs from other services) could opt-in to host their comments on discuss.wordpress.com.</p>
<p><strong>The benefits are plentiful</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep using the WordPress.com authentication &amp; userbase built up by JetPack Comments.</li>
<li>Encourage expansive social interaction between users, just like Matt envisioned.</li>
<li>Discover and be discovered.</li>
<li>Many great avenues for paid services, e.g. full blown forums.</li>
<li>Significantly faster growth for bbPress, a project much closer to home than IntenseDebate ever was.</li>
</ul>
<p>tl;dr: Automattic, please put all of your people still working on IntenseDebate and JetPack Comments to work on bbPress.org as a kick-ass open source forum package and hosted service. That‚Äôs where the next generation of comments is at.</p>

Well, at least on the hill I live on. Welcome to another installment of what we like to call The Daily Plugin, where we plug you into the newest and most interesting plugins found in the WordPress Plugin Repository. Like we always say, make sure to test any plugin on a development or staging site before you go live with anything. Our listings are not official endorsement, rating or rankings, but an occasional virtual fist bump might be thrown down if a plugin is really good. Let&#8217;s see what we have today..</p>
<p><a title="Responsiv WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/responsiv/" target="_blank">Responsiv</a> helps you to develop responsive sites by displaying the current browser width and id of the device at the top of the page. I ordinarily need to use a Firefox Add-In to check the browser width and have another that emulates specific mobile devices. Now I can kill both of those and use a native WordPress plugin instead! I can only imagine how this would help a theme developer create in a much faster and streamlined environment. It worked well for me.</p>
<p><a title="Wordpress Landing Pages Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/landing-pages/" target="_blank">WordPress Landing Pages</a> was recently updated and is something that I will be testing again extensively over the next few weeks. A/B testing I should say! This plugin from David Wells and Hudson Atwell. It allows you to create specific offer or call to action pages that are meant to generate leads or sales with one page of marketing material. This plugin helps to aid in the setup in creating landing pages through WordPress with a step by step start procedure. The beauty of this plugin is that it also gives you the ability to A/B test, in other words test one page vs a second page and monitor the results for the best success rate. Being completely integrated is a true blessing, as are some of the other modules that they have available as a paid add-in. They have many free add-ins as well that provide extra enhancements like Gravity Forms integration and Exit Pop-Ups. For my two cents, this is a plugin worth checking out if you are doing any kind of Pay-Per-Click ads on Google and have a WordPress site. Here&#8217;s a video that shows more:</p>
<div class="aligncenter"></div>
<p><a title="Spin ReWriter" href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/spinrewriter" target="_blank">SpinRewriter</a> is a plugin that claims to provide the functionality to use &#8220;spintax&#8221; to create randomized phrases and sentence replacement. This is done by placing the text to be randomized in brackets with a pipe delimited modifier. For example: Theodore is a {red|blue|yellow} stuffed {dog|cat|bear} would randomize the color and animal type and theoretically be able to output one of many possible sentences. With that being said, this plugin not only does not work as claimed, but it will not work at all WITHOUT PAYING FOR IT. This plugin needs to be pulled from the repository immediately. Bad execution, bad developer tactics.</p>

This plugin allows you the ability to create a private storage area for your customers that includes private files, invoices, and even a notification/message option that let&#8217;s you send a message one-on-one. As someone who uses heavy-duty project management systems that cost upwards of $400 a month, I can tell you that this plugin has some really good options for those with just a few clients or are on a tight company budget. This could also be good as a pseudo-intranet solution within a company or work groups. Worth checking out if you have the need.</p>
<p>Slim picking today in the Repository, but we&#8217;ll be shaking the repository trees a bit harder tomorrow. Rumor is that a few of the most popular plugins out there are due for some pretty massive overhauls. Until then, you can contact me on Twitter <a title="Marcus Couch on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/marcuscouch">@marcuscouch</a> or leave your feedback here on WPTavern!</p>

I&#8217;m giving an advanced development talk on Saturday called¬†<strong>Current User Can Watch This Talk</strong>. Props to fellow lead developer Mark Jaquith (who is also speaking) for coming up with that clever talk title. Here&#8217;s the description:</p>
<blockquote><p>At first glance, the WordPress roles and capabilities system is simple. Users have roles, roles have capabilities, and plugins can make simple changes to them. Done, right? Not quite: You‚Äôve been doing it the hard way. A deeper look inside the API reveals a surprising amount of flexibility, including the single most powerful (and dangerous) filter in WordPress. In this talk, you‚Äôll learn how capabilities are ‚Äúmapped‚Äù to other capabilities, and what the difference between primitive and meta capabilities means for your plugins and custom post types. We‚Äôll explore the true hidden powers of the API, like using capability mapping to selectively grant and revoke privileges on the fly, making complex user management more maintainable.</p></blockquote>
<p>The single most powerful and dangerous filter in WordPress? That sounds both ominous and awesome if you ask me.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in presentations aimed at advanced developers at WordCamp San Francisco this year, make sure to also catch the illustrious Mike Adams and Andy Skelton. Mike is talking about security in &#8220;Three Security Issues You Thought You‚Äôd Fixed.&#8221; Andy will be presenting a new approach to performance in &#8220;How pcntl_fork() Can Save Us.&#8221; I&#8217;m really looking forward to what they have to say and you should do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also looking forward to talks by Will Norris, Nikolay Bachiyski, and Helen Hou-Sandi. Together, those are six names who have greatly influenced not just WordPress development, but my own work and the contributions of many others. Check out the full line-up <a href="http://2013.sf.wordcamp.org/2013/06/21/say-hello-to-our-first-round-of-speakers/">here</a> and <a href="http://2013.sf.wordcamp.org/2013/06/28/our-final-round-of-speakers/">here</a>. A few <a href="http://2013.sf.wordcamp.org/tickets/">tickets are still available</a>¬†for the July 26‚Äì27 conference.</p>
<p>I also hope to see a lot of people at the Contribute Day on Sunday. I&#8217;m helping organize that, and WordPress 3.7 will be underway by then ‚Äî more to come on both soon.</p>

In the <a title="http://www.checkmarx.com/white_papers/the-security-state-of-wordpress-top-50-plugins/" href="http://www.checkmarx.com/white_papers/the-security-state-of-wordpress-top-50-plugins/">report published on June 18th, 2013</a> Checkmarx concluded that more than 20% of the 50 most popular WordPress plugins were vulnerable to common web attacks such as SQL injection. Furthermore, the report revealed that 7 out of the 10 most popular e-commerce plugins for WordPress contained vulnerabilities. First, some background information regarding how the report was put together.</p>
<p>The research in this survey has nothing to do with the core security of WordPress but rather, the plugins available for it. It&#8217;s important to consider this distinction when reviewing the report. An automated static code analysis developed by Checkmarx was used to scan the source code against the most popular plugins. These included the 50 most downloaded plugins as well as the 10 most popular e-commerce plugins. The scans occurred on two separate occasions. The first was during <strong>January 2013</strong> while the second took place in early <strong>June of 2013</strong>.</p>
<p>During the first scan, Checkmarx discovered 18 vulnerabilities and notified the developers of four of the vulnerable plugins, then worked with them to apply fixes. After 6 months, the WordPress plugin repository indicated that all 18 plugins had updated versions. The scan was used on these updated versions to see if the vulnerabilities had been fixed. Their automated tool was set to notify when one of the following vulnerabilities was discovered:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SQL Injection (SQLi).</strong> Allows the execution of commands on the back-end server, such as the extraction of sensitive information. In a hosted environment, a SQL Injection attack can further be used as a stepping stone for attacks against non-vulnerable sites. The attacker in this environment can manipulate the database shared by both vulnerable and non-vulnerable sites.</li>
<li><strong>Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</strong>. Allows the running of a script on the client in order to bypass access controls. This kind of vulnerability targets all visitors to the site. In a hosted environment, this problem is exacerbated where an attack can also be used to steal the session cookies of the site admin. Effectively, it allows the attacker to imposter the admin.</li>
<li><strong>Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong>. Allows the attacker to perform an application-level transaction on behalf of the victim. In a hosted environment, an attacker can log onto the site on the admin‚Äôs behalf and perform nefarious activities such as re-directing users or performing admin transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Remote/ Local File Inclusion (RFI/ LFI)</strong>. Allows the uploading of a potentially malicious file to the server. In a CMS environment this is a particularly critical vulnerability as the point of the CMS is to manage and deliver site-related files.</li>
<li><strong>Path Traversal</strong>. Allows the attacker to crawl the Web pages. In a CMS environment an attacker can exploit this type of vulnerability to access and map all hosted files.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Checkmarx tested the plugins for Path Traversal vulnerabilities only during the second scan.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The findings from the second security scan were definitely an eye opener for me.</li>
<li>20% of the 50 most popular plugins contained one or more of the vulnerabilities listed above.</li>
<li>7 out of the top 10 most popular e-commerce plugins were vulnerable to common web attacks</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no correlation between the number of <strong>Lines of Code (LOC)</strong> and the vulnerability level of the plugins. Every line of code has the potential impact of introducing a vulnerability. However, Checkmarx has found that the opposite does not hold true. Meaning, the smaller the codebase does not necessarily mean the safer the code. On the contrary ‚Äì some plugins that included only a few thousand lines of code contained more types of vulnerabilities than plugins containing tens of thousands lines of code.</p>
<p>Only six plugins out of the 50 scanned in January were completely fixed during the six-month time period between scans. The following screenshot is taken from page 5 of the report that highlights which plugins were fixed. An important note to take away from these 6 plugins is that all of them were notified of their vulnerabilities by Checkmarx. Nowhere in the report is it mentioned that the authors of all the other plugins were afforded the same courtesy.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SecurityReport.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7632" alt="Security Report" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SecurityReport.jpg?resize=500%2C387" /></a></p>
<p>The report has sound advice some of which has been preached repeatedly over the years. For <strong>starters</strong>, only download plugins from reputable sources. The most notable is the <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/">WordPress plugin repository</a>. By the way, I&#8217;ve noticed more plugin authors hosting their code on <a title="https://github.com/" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> only. Take heed plugin authors that if you do this, by default, you&#8217;ve lost a degree or two of trustworthiness because GitHub <strong>is not </strong>the WordPress plugin repository. Instead, I highly recommend having a GitHub version that is kept in-synch with a WordPress plugin repository version. <a title="http://wp.tutsplus.com/tutorials/plugins/publishing-wordpress-plug-ins-with-git/" href="http://wp.tutsplus.com/tutorials/plugins/publishing-wordpress-plug-ins-with-git/">This article on WP Tuts+</a> does a good job explaining how to do that.</p>
<p>Their <strong>second</strong> piece of advice is to verify the security posture of a plugin by scanning it for security issues. I take issue with this piece of advice because it&#8217;s not like we as end users have a scanner in our back pocket. There is one plugin that is maintained by members of the core WordPress development team called <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/exploit-scanner/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/exploit-scanner/">Exploit Scanner</a>. However, this plugin is not meant to be a security scanner for plugins, it&#8217;s more for monitoring suspicious activity on a website.</p>
<p><strong>Three</strong>. Make sure plugins are kept up to date. Thanks to the ease of updating plugins, even in bulk, this is for the most part a painless process.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth.</strong> Remove any unused plugins. If a plugin is no longer necessary, remove it instead of leaving it on the site deactivated. Use the option to delete the plugin along with its files from the WordPress plugin manager.</p>
<p>The report ends with recommendations to plugin developers and the WordPress plugin repository as well as any other application platform provider. Plugin authors are encouraged to integrate security within their development process.</p>
<blockquote><p>The later a vulnerability is discovered, the higher the cost of fixing. But there‚Äôs more: a simple fix does not guarantee that the plugin users updated their sites. And until they do, these admins are left with the vulnerable plugins. The solution? Bake security within the plugin development as part of your secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process.</p></blockquote>
<p>WordPress is not the only platform that has to deal with third-party issues like plugin security. According to Checkmarx, app marketplaces like the WordPress.org repository should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enforce a security policy on apps that enter the marketplace. Although the security of a plugin may seem to be the developer‚Äôs problem, platform providers are held responsible in the light of users. Make security your competitive edge and build a marketplace where users can feel secure to return to.</li>

<p>There is more to the report than what I&#8217;ve covered in this post which you can <a title="http://www.checkmarx.com/white_papers/the-security-state-of-wordpress-top-50-plugins/" href="http://www.checkmarx.com/white_papers/the-security-state-of-wordpress-top-50-plugins/">download and read for free</a> via their website.</p>
<h2>Where Does This Report Leave Us?</h2>
<p>WordPress plugin security has always been an issue that occasionally pops to the forefront of people&#8217;s minds. A good example is the <a title="http://blog.sucuri.net/2013/05/w3-total-cache-and-wp-super-cache-vulnerability-being-targeted-in-the-wild.html" href="http://blog.sucuri.net/2013/05/w3-total-cache-and-wp-super-cache-vulnerability-being-targeted-in-the-wild.html">W3 Total Cache and WP Super Cache plugin vulnerabilities</a> in May of this year. It&#8217;s also a discussion we&#8217;ve been having for years. In 2009, I asked <a title="http://www.wptavern.com/is-a-plugin-validation-team-a-pipe-dream" href="http://www.wptavern.com/is-a-plugin-validation-team-a-pipe-dream">whether a plugin validation team was a pipe dream</a>. The idea was taken from the phpBB project where the mod database would only allow mods to be hosted if they passed a strict code review process, ensuring the highest quality mods in an official, central location. Unfortunately, this method really hampered the growth of third-party extensions in their mod repository.</p>
<p>Today, there are at least a few members of the plugin review team for WordPress.org. These volunteers act as the front-line for plugins submitted to the plugin repository. (<strong>Thank you by the way for your work</strong>) Check out <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/">these detailed guidelines</a> on what it takes to be hosted on the repository.</p>
<p>One of the arguments against having a dedicated team reviewing every line of code for submitted plugins is that there are already a large amount of eyeballs looking over code. Since everything is open-source, anyone can review the code. If the results of the report published by Checkmarx is any indication, there are not enough security minded folks dissecting plugins. It&#8217;s even more worrisome when you consider the results were based on the 50 most popular plugins. Those plugins should have had the most scrutiny considering their popularity yet, they contained vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>A Big Problem With No Easy Answer:</h2>
<p>On the surface, plugin security is a big problem that can not be solved with one action. Instead, it&#8217;s going to take a multi-layered approach. Education is key. The <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/plugin-developer-handbook/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/plugin-developer-handbook/">plugin developer handbook</a> being worked on as part of the handbook series of projects should be the starting point for all WordPress plugin developers. Especially <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/plugin-developer-handbook/plugin-security/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/plugin-developer-handbook/plugin-security/">part three</a> which focuses on plugin security.</p>
<p>If Checkmarx is able to create an automated scanning analysis tool to discover vulnerabilities within the source code of plugins, why hasn&#8217;t the plugin repository come up with something similar that plugin authors could use as a tool or resource? At the very least, create a plugin that has the scanner built-in. Or, use the scanner as part of the process to review plugins and send them back to the author if a vulnerability is discovered.</p>
<p>The biggest impact and the one that would make all WordPress users safer would be implementing stricter policies with plugins on the repository. Unfortunately, restrictions and policies go against the open-source nature of WordPress. There is a fine line between the amount and difficulty of rules to be hosted on the repository versus going at it alone. I&#8217;d hate to see plugin authors give up hosting on the repository simply because it&#8217;s too difficult because of the policies. Some would even argue that the guidelines currently in place make it too difficult to be hosted on the repository.</p>
<p>By the way, if you think someone would be able to make a buck by reviewing code for themes and plugins, you&#8217;re wrong.¬†Sites such as¬†DevPress Code Review¬†were launched only to disappear and ideas like¬†<a href="http://WPCodeReview.com">WPCodeReview.com</a>¬†were discussed but never materialized. While a good idea that was <a title="http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-August/034146.html" href="http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-August/034146.html">backed by people</a> on the WordPress Hackers mailing list, reality proved otherwise.</p>
<h2>Throwing My Hands Up In The Air:</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s going to take to solve the problem of plugin security. The more I think about it, the more it seems like it&#8217;s a necessary evil of open-source software. For as long as I&#8217;ve been active in the WordPress community, it&#8217;s been accepted by many that the plugin repository is filled with insecure code. The report by Checkmarx not only verifies that thinking, but shows that the problem could be bigger than anyone thought. One of the most unfortunate things about third-party plugins and themes is that if a site is compromised because of them, WordPress usually ends up taking the blame.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s depressing to think that so many people who love using WordPress are going to end up needing to hire someone to monitor their sites full-time or plunk down cash on something like VaultPress because of the epidemic of plugin vulnerabilities. The ease and joy of using WordPress quickly goes out the window with the introduction of the webmaster security hat. I think it&#8217;s reasonable to believe that the last thought on most WordPress users minds who add functionality to their site through plugins are not wondering if whether or not that plugin contains a security vulnerability. They just want that plugin to work without breaking anything else. To a point, I don&#8217;t think they should have to worry about it. WordPress users are repeatedly told to install/use plugins from a trusted source, the most trusted source being the WordPress plugin repository. <strong>What good is a plugin repository with thousands of plugins if all they end up being are ingredients to a toxic soup of disaster?</strong></p>
<p>As the plugin repository continues to increase in size, so does the epidemic. WordPress community, what is the cure?</p>

This is not a new idea &#8212; it is rooted in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/#decisions">guiding philosophies for WordPress</a> to make decisions, not options.</p>
<address>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Hacker News is now up in arms about <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5968237">Firefox 23 removing the &#8220;Disable Javascript&#8221; option</a>. I&#8217;m really glad to see ex-Mozilla guy¬†<a href="http://gkoberger.net/">Gregory Koberger</a>¬†with the top comment there, linking to a fantastic piece called <a href="http://limi.net/checkboxes-that-kill/">Checkboxes that kill your product</a>. &#8220;A¬†little historical baggage can be a dangerous thing when multiplied by a few hundred million individuals,&#8221; wrote¬†Alex Limi, who does product design strategy at Mozilla. (I had a chance to meet Gregory at a conference in 2011 and he&#8217;s a great web dev follow <a href="https://twitter.com/gkoberger">on Twitter</a>.)</address>
<p>In WordPress 3.5, I spearheaded a quiet but major purge of UI options. We removed <strong>ten</strong> of them. And we moved another off its own page, which let us drop down to six settings pages, down from eight in 2010. My napkin math shows we removed <em>15 percent</em> of all settings. That&#8217;s a huge improvement. Some of these were break-your-site options. Others might cause confusion. And we have ongoing efforts to simplify or improve a few other settings as well.</p>
<p>When talking about decisions versus options, I often tell the story of Firefox 4&#8242;s change to tabs on top. I even watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmgtW2Iw-kE">a seven-minute YouTube video</a> explaining exactly why this was a better user experience. (And I couldn&#8217;t agree more.) But then, at the end of the video, after all of the convincing arguments, they mention there is an option to put it back. My heart sank. It was a compelling video, but the community forced them to compromise by keeping in core a completely separate workflow, despite making a strong statement that it was <em>clearly inferior</em>. Firefox is highly extensible. An extension could have changed it back. By keeping it in Firefox core, you now have double the user flows to test, your QA testing suffers, users suffer, everything suffers.</p>
<p>Firefox may be the people&#8217;s browser, it may be the one true open browser project, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it is a kitchen sink.¬†I didn&#8217;t actually¬†realize that Firefox still had the Disable JavaScript option. I have been using an extension to toggle JavaScript in Firefox, as sometimes I have to test no-JS situations. The fact that I didn&#8217;t know the option existed, though, is only one indication that this is a problem. This single option enables a user to do so much damage to their web browsing experience that it is absurd for it to exist. This is Limi&#8217;s point.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t quote from the writings of GNOME contributor Havoc Pennington enough. His posts did a lot to inform early development of WordPress, and continue to make an impact today.¬†Here&#8217;s what I shared in 2011:</p>
<blockquote><p>It turns out that preferences have a cost. Of course, some preferences also have important benefits ‚Äì and can be crucial interface features. But each one has a price, and you have to carefully consider its value. Many users and developers don‚Äôt understand this, and end up with a lot of cost and little value for their preferences dollar.</p>
<ul>
<li>Too many preferences means you can‚Äôt find any of them.</li>
<li>Preferences really substantively damage QA and testing.</li>
<li>Preferences make integration and good UI difficult.</li>
<li>The point of a good program is to do something specific and do it well.</li>
<li>Preferences keep people from fixing real bugs.</li>
<li>Preferences can confuse many users.</li>
</ul>
<p>I find that if you‚Äôre hard-core disciplined about having good defaults that Just Work instead of lazily adding preferences, that naturally leads the overall UI in the right direction. Issues come up via bugzilla or mailing lists or user testing, and you fix them in some way other than adding a preference, and this means you have to think about the right UI and the right way to fix problems. Basically, using preferences as a band-aid is the root of much UI evil.</p></blockquote>
<p>For more written by Pennington, see these essays from <a href="http://ometer.com/free-software-ui.html">2002</a> and <a href="http://ometer.com/features.html">2004</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps tellingly, I also wrote then &#8220;WordPress is known for its simplicity and usability, but I can still think of a half-dozen options I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to remove under the right circumstances.&#8221; In WordPress 3.5, the circumstances were right. Promise kept!</p>
<p><em>Addendum:</em>¬†In that long Hacker News thread (300 comments and climbing) Gregory also commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Try an extension? Power users aren&#8217;t the target market for this decision, and that&#8217;s why add-ons exist.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is also a great time to review the sections¬†<a href="http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/#majority">Designing for the Majority</a>¬†and¬†<a href="http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/#minority">The Vocal Minority</a>¬†on the¬†WordPress philosophy page.</p>

It&#8217;s time to start your week with another fresh batch of plugins from the WordPress Plugins Repository. As we venture into the details of each plugin, bear in mind that none of this text represents endorsements or official ratings. This is merely a sampling of what new plugins have been released and my immediate reactions and possible usage examples. Remember to always test plugins on a staging or development site before going live. If you enjoy the plugins you learn about, please consider making a donation to the authors of any plugins you use. It helps to keep the community thriving and might just make the difference in a developer deciding to continue upgrading the plugin in the future. With that said, let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>
<p><strong><a title="Attachment Files Importer" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/attachment-files-importer/" target="_blank">Attachment Files Importer</a></strong> is a new plugin that helps with an age-old problem when dealing with migrating a WordPress site from a staging area to a live domain. often times all of the posts export and import correctly, however the media doesn&#8217;t seem to make its way over to the new site as easily as you would expect. This plug-in helps fill that gap by creating a bridge from your old content to the new content copying over the necessary files and images to your new site. In case of duplicates it does not overwrite any existing files. For any of you web design specialists who use WordPress and frequently migrate over content, this is a plug-in you might want to take a look at.</p>
<p><strong><a title="NT Redirect" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/nt-redirect/" target="_blank">NT Redirect</a></strong> is an easy &#8220;set and forget&#8221; plugin that takes every external link and automatically applies a rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; attribute to them.¬† This is great if you want to control the &#8220;link leakage&#8221; that you just don&#8217;t have time to police yourself all the time. There are often other plugins that pull in affiliate feeds, rss feeds, etc. These plugins are often automated and you do not always have control in how the links come over. This plugin solves that by enforcing an across the site solution of nofollow.</p>
<p><strong><a title="HashBuddy - Hashtags for Buddypress" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/hashbuddy/" target="_blank">HashBuddy</a></strong> allows you the capability to insert #hash tags into BuddyPress similar to the functionality in Twitter and Facebook. This allows your BuddyPress users to filter topics and activities based on topic hashtags. This is a pretty cool way to provide even more functionality with BuddyPress. I run a BP site that could really use this instead of the default search function results.</p>
<p><strong><a title="WP Remember Your Posts" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-remember-your-posts/" target="_blank">WP Remember Your Posts</a></strong> is a bit of a blogging history reminder, personalized just for you. Essentially this plugin will email you to remind you of your posts from one year earlier. Though in some cases with some of my early blogs with infrequent posting activity, I&#8217;m afraid this plugin would run out of things to do rather quickly. However, if you are a frequent poster and have use to reference something that happened &#8220;a year ago on this date&#8221;, then this may be a plugin that will drive your inspiration or at least subtle nostalgia.</p>
<p><strong><a title="Reddit Lurker WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/reddit-lurker/" target="_blank">Reddit Lurker</a></strong> &#8211; This Reddit plugin allows access to Reddit&#8217;s API in WordPress. Place a shortcode of¬† in your posts or pages and output Reddit links, votes, usernames and comments from individually designated &#8220;sub-reddits&#8221;. The plugin only works one way, pulling the data from Reddit. It will not go the other way and post any comments or otherwise TO Reddit.</p>
<p><strong><a title="Show Once" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/showonce/" target="_blank">Show Once</a> </strong>has my brain spinning today. It&#8217;s a plugin that as it&#8217;s namesake implies, let&#8217;s you use a shortcode that shows content only once to a visitor. For example it shows one-time messages to users that requires a &#8220;dismiss&#8221; or &#8220;agreed&#8221; button to be hit. It can be used as a new user welcome message for first time site visitors or even as agreements to terms and conditions. You can also incorporate direct post IDs into the shortcode so that pull from your existing post content, such as [ShowOnce post=420] would output post id#420, or [ShowOnce post=33,212,420] would output the contents of posts ids 33, 212 and 420. When you add something like date qualifiers it can display from only certain start points, display until a certain end point, or display between a range of dates. Acknowledgements are assigned as required through the shortcode as well. [ShowOnce post=420 show=dismiss style=2 from=10/11/13 to=12/11/13] Will display contents of ShowOnce custom post id 420 and will not be removed until the user clicks the &#8220;dismiss&#8221; link that uses custom css style id 2 (which you would have to have created yourself) from the date specified forward, with no end date. Wow, this one does a ton. I am still wrapping my head around all the possibilities that this could conjure up, especially when considering you use other posts for the content. This would allow you to use other shortcodes and layouts to populate the item being shown once. Very clever idea and well worth checking out.</p>
<p>Join us again tomorrow as we sift through the Repository in search of plugin nuggets worth bragging about. You can follow me on Twitter <a title="Marcus Couch on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/marcuscouch" target="_blank">@marcuscouch</a> or leave your feedback here at <a title="The Daily Plugin for 07/01/2013" href="http://wptavern.com/the-daily-plugin-for-7-1-2013">WPTavern</a> regarding your thoughts and comments for these plugins.</p>

It&#8217;s encouraging to see the growth of the submission flow over the course of several years. Not only do we see a big variety of new plugins in both the subject matter and functionality, but there are much many older or abandoned plugins that are being retooled and re-released by newly energized coders and developers. Before we dive in to today&#8217;s samplings remember that the following plugins are not endorsements or ratings but rather small samples of what new plugins have been published into the WordPress Plugin Repository. Always test on a staging or development site before going live and make a backup of any live site before activating. OK, let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fancy-message-box/screenshot-1.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignright" alt="WP Fancy Message Box" src="http://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fancy-message-box/screenshot-1.png?resize=167%2C202" /></a><a title="WP Fancy Message Box" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fancy-message-box/" target="_blank">WP Fancy Message Box</a> enables many different message or error boxes in various styles and colors which you can configure. Implemented via shortcode, such as <strong><em>[wpfmb type='info' theme=1]your message[/wpfmb]</em></strong><em></em>.<em> </em>As you can see, there are many different message box &#8220;themes&#8221; you can use, like success, error, warning, info, or whatever options you would like to customize. It would be great to have complete control over colors, icons used and other CSS options, though it can easily be hacked through to make the design conform to your choosing. <em><br />
</em></p>
<p><a title="AwesomePress" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/awesomepress/" target="_blank">AwesomePress</a> This offering enables <a title="FontAwesome" href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a> Icons for WordPress. For those of you who are not aware of it, FontAwesome is a font specifically designed for Bootstrap that allows you to use a common font to display frequently used web icons. There are over 350 high resolution scalable vector icons in the single font with full CSS control. This results in a WordPress site with clean, defined icons and category headings.</p>
<p><a title="Vimeo Master" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/vimeo-master/" target="_blank">Vimeo Master</a> is a new plugin presenting you the ability to embed any Vimeo video in HTML 5 code format. What impresses me about this plugin is that it contains no Ajax or JavaScript. This allows for fast load time and is completely responsive. Short codes can be used to embed the video anywhere within your WordPress installation. You have full control over size, color, looping and autoplay options are also available. You also have the option to display links to your Vimeo profile.</p>
<p><a title="Thumbnail Upload" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/thumbnail-uploads/" target="_blank">Thumbnail Upload</a> is a plugin that permits you to upload your own thumbnail in relation to a specific post. This overrides any featured image resize options that may be in place which would ordinarily serve up a thumbnail. I enjoy having the creative freedom to choose my own thumbnails for my posts. There are often times in which I want to use an animated gif file to highlight a particular story or featured blog posts. By allowing this option I am now able to provide a much more aesthetic look and feel that conforms to the theme that I am using.</p>
<p><a title="Disable Author Pages" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-author-pages/" target="_blank">Disable Author Pages</a> allows you The opportunity to disable the standard ../author URL designation and instead redirect to a dedicated page. This is something that I&#8217;ve always thought WordPress lacked when it came to providing attribution to the author. This plugin allows for a completely new page to be created that contains an author&#8217;s bio, social networking channels, and even the most recent feed items from a multitude of sources around the Internet. This plugin is a big improvement over the off the rack options provided by your standard WordPress installation.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/wp-ultimate-recipe/assets/screenshot-1.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignright" alt="WP Ultimate Recipe" src="http://i0.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/wp-ultimate-recipe/assets/screenshot-1.png?resize=311%2C427" /></a><a title="WP Ultimate Recipe" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-ultimate-recipe/" target="_blank">WP Ultimate Recipe</a> helps those who want to create an archival of recipes on their WordPress site. It utilizes short codes or simply by clicking on the &#8220;insert recipe&#8221; button within the editor itself. The features for this plugin are quite robust, tracking ingredients, what type of course the meal is, ethnicity and cuisine type. All of these are tracked as taxonomies which means that you can sort them by any of the fields mentioned. This would result in being able to view all recipes that contain a specific ingredient, or listing all desserts as a type of cuisine selection. Photos can be added to show any stage of the recipe from start to finish. There is also an option to print the recipe with or without images. The plugin is fully responsive on all devices. It is also easily translatable, and I have tested it with Google translate with favorable results. The output looks great and entering recipes into the system is simple to do.</p>
<p>Join us again on Monday for another edition of the Daily Plugin as we unwrap the cellophane on the newest plugins from the WordPress repository. As always you can find me on Twitter <a title="Marcus Couch on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/marcuscouch" target="_blank">@marcuscouch</a> or leave your feedback right here at WP Tavern. Enjoy the weekend everyone!</p>

<p>My main focus with <a title="http://wpsessions.com" href="http://wpsessions.com">WPSessions</a> is to provide high quality content to help train the greater WordPress community. I&#8217;m hoping to accomplish this in two ways: <strong>1)</strong> Pay expert presenters for their time so that I can curate high quality presentations on an on-going basis; <strong>2)</strong> Eventually release the presentations for free on <a title="http://www.wordpress.tv" href="http://www.wordpress.tv">WordPress.tv</a> to expand and improve our collective knowledge base. I&#8217;m also doing this for myself, because I really want to learn from all the presenters I&#8217;ve selected, specifically.</p>
<p><strong>How will WPSessions be different than say, WPClassroom.com?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WPClassroomlogo.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7590" alt="WPClassroom Logo" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WPClassroomlogo.png?resize=240%2C70" /></a></p>
<p>The focus of WP sessions is largely based on the idea of an on-demand WordCamp, broadcast directly into your home and available on your own time. It is not intended to be a course-based learning site, or a series of instructional lessons, but a monthly event featuring live presentations and Q&amp;A with lots of different experts. I didn&#8217;t want to build something that competed with the many great resources that already exist in our community (e.g. <a href="http://webdesign.com">http://webdesign.com</a>, <a href="http://wp101.com">http://wp101.com</a>, <a href="http://bobwp.com">http://bobwp.com</a>, etc), rather I wanted to build something that complimented them.</p>
<p><strong>Will any of these sessions find their way onto WordPress.tv?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! All of them, in fact. My primary goal when I set out to launch the site was to build something that could benefit everyone, regardless of how much money they had set aside for their own education. So, because of that, every presentation will make its way to WordPress.tv four months after the session has aired. The time delay, for any curious, is indeed to help sell more tickets and offset the up-front cost of hosting these events.</p>
<p><strong>If people have to pay for a seat to attend a session and these sessions will at some point arrive on WordPress.tv, where is the incentive to pay now instead of wait and watch later?</strong></p>
<p>The incentive, I think, is to help fund a new community-focused project and reward those who are willing to teach. Certainly, it grants you earlier access to the content, but it also gives you an opportunity to put some money back in the pockets of each expert who is taking time out of their busy schedule to impart their hard-won knowledge. Paying for the sessions, I think, also helps underscore the value of the knowledge and experience being shared. Sure, you can find much of what these experts have to teach on your own for free, but not all of it, and definitely not in such a conveniently packaged and digestible format (nor do you have such direct access to ask these experts questions).</p>
<p>Additionally, paying for sessions will also help me fund scholarships for people who are looking to bolster their knowledge and skills, but have no money to invest just yet (e.g. students)</p>
<p><strong>You have two sessions to start out. <a title="http://wpsessions.com/sessions/building-a-wordpress-business/" href="http://wpsessions.com/sessions/building-a-wordpress-business/">Building A WordPress Business</a> and <a title="http://wpsessions.com/sessions/building-wordpress-plugins/" href="http://wpsessions.com/sessions/building-wordpress-plugins/">Building WordPress Plugins</a>. Any other sessions planned for later this year you can tell us about?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/UpcomingSessions.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7589" alt="Upcoming Sessions" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/UpcomingSessions.png?resize=500%2C79" /></a><br />
I have spoken with 27 different experts from our community so far, and all of them have said yes to presenting. I can only tell you about the next two sessions for certain, though, because I haven&#8217;t planned anything out beyond that. All of this depends on the first two sessions not being a total flop :)</p>
<p>The third session, happening sometime in August, will focus on Performance-driven Development and feature the mighty brains of Daniel Bachhuber, Aaron Jorbin and Zack Tollman.¬†I&#8217;m planning on a double-session for September, a WP Theme Bootcamp so to speak, featuring six different theme experts each talking about a different aspect of the theme building process. From there, I already have enough experts and topics to carry us into February.</p>
<p><strong>The idea of scholarships is intriguing. What kind of scholarships were you thinking of offering at some point?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to be able to offer a couple of different scholarship levels: semester (4 months) and year-long. The limit of how many I can give away really depends on how many tickets I can sell, but I&#8217;d love to admit 10 students to each level at each interval. This could also be a good opportunity for responsible sponsors and/or donations, perhaps, we&#8217;ll see how things go.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us some of the technology that will help WPSessions tick such as what you&#8217;ll be using for streaming live video and if the site will be utilizing any special plugins?</strong></p>
<p>Sure! At the moment the storefront is powered by WooCommerce. I&#8217;m running Stripe to handle credit card payments, and PayPal to facilitate anyone who can&#8217;t/doesn&#8217;t want to use a credit card. For these first two sessions I&#8217;m using Google Hangout to handle the presentations, but I&#8217;m looking into other options for the long-haul. The session viewing page itself is powered by a custom plugin I wrote just for this purpose. It registers a &#8220;Session&#8221; post type, and then uses custom meta fields for storing relevant information and posts-to-posts for connecting the session to its experts (users) and product. Beyond that, it also has a bit of logic to control who can see the content, and what content to show at what time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also running Gravity Forms to power the contact page and follow-up surveys, BackupBuddy to facilitate scheduled site backups, and a couple of other utility plugins I wrote to make WooCommerce more friendly for my purposes. I might also integrate BadgeOS for awarding digital badges for each session attended, which I think might be pretty neat to collect.</p>
<p><strong>Last but not least, anything you&#8217;d like to say to the general WordPress community concerning WPSessions?</strong></p>
<p>What I&#8217;d really like is some critical feedback on the project. I think it&#8217;s a great idea, of course, and I&#8217;m really excited about it, but I&#8217;d love to hear more from a broader scope of people. Are they even interested in this style of live-training? Is there anything I could add or do differently that makes it more attractive? Which time of the week is most convenient for the largest number of people around the world? Do more people want deeper, high-level presentations, or entry-level/introductory presentations? I have lots of guesses, but no firm answers.</p>
<p>At the moment it&#8217;s all just theory and one great experiment. I hope that others are interested and excited, and I hope they vote with their dollars that this idea should exist so I can help it grow :)</p>
