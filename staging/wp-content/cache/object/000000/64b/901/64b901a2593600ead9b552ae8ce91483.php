Recommended as the best headset, hands down, in this article: http://www.gamersnexus.net/pc-builds/46-pcbuildupg/1042-pro-streaming-diy-video-editing-pc


Microphone

Get a professional microphone and pop filter

Condenser microphones are more fragile, but higher quality. Pop filters remove breathing and sharp P's

Great condenser microphone

Cheaper (and great) condenser microphone

Also on Newegg
newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16836431002&amp;cm_re=condenser_microphone-_-36-431-002-_-Product

Use the middle setting and speak close to the microphone (almost touching the pop filter, and the pop filter is almost touching the microphone).

Pop filter, four layers

Use this Audacity equalizer settings file to minimize the P's and S's (most get removed by the pop filter, but this removes the few that get through).

^-- Tobias and Chris Voltsis recommend

Tobias:
beyerdynamics mmx 300 is a top-quality headset and condenser mic, $350+
More affordable, get Snowball or the at2020
For headset, try the Sennheiser pc 151 or 360

Headset

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826785001&amp;cm_re=asus_headset-_-26-785-001-_-Product
Comfortable, good microphone quality, wireless!

Hard drive

Your hard drive must be able to maintain at least 30 mb/s to record at HD.
30 mb/s at 720p
60 mb/s at 1080p
Do not record to your C: drive - Windows keeps this drive busy.

Recommended
SATA D: drive (IDE is too slow)
eSATA (external SATA) drive
USB 3.0 (USB 2.0 is too slow)
Recommended 2tb SATA drive

The Medium size tablet in my opinion is the best size as I can easily put it on one knee while commentating - this is the model I linked above.

The tablet comes with some software keys after you register. I recommend applying to get all the keys and download all of the software as it costs nothing extra.

The program I use is the Autodesk Sketchpad 2011 (one of the free keys) as it supports the pen weight sensing and layers. Since I spent most of my high school years after class working in an architects office, my writing works best with a soft lead pencil, which the Autodesk software supports. I also picked up Inkscape for doing vector graphics when needed (a la Corel Draw), as well as The GIMP which is my Photoshop replacement. Both are GNU software foundation products (from my linux background) and also FREE!

Software

Fraps is the best realtime video capture tool.
www.fraps.com

Recommended hotkeys
Prt Scr
Screenshot hotkey

Scroll Lock
Video capture hotkey

Pause
FPS overlay hotkey

In the Movies tab
Check "Hide mouse cursor in video"
Only show the cursor when recording reviews or guides that need it

30 fps full-size
Record at "30 fps" and "Full-size"
YouTube converts videos to 30 fps

While playing a game, the fps is color coded
Yellow
Normal

Fraps is idle and shows the current fps

Pink
Cache recording only the last 30 seconds
Hold Scroll Lock for one second until it turns pink

Always use cache mode.

This way, Fraps is constantly recording but keeps only the last 30 seconds. You don't run out of hard disk space, and if something exciting just happened, it is recorded!

Then, press Scroll Lock to enter normal recording mode (turns red).

Red
Recording video
Press Scroll Lock to turn recording on and off

At 720p, one minute takes 1.6 gb of space
At 1080p, one minute takes 3.6 gb of space

Black
Press Prt Scr to take a screenshot

Flashes black for half a second while taking the screenshot

Commentate

Commentating is recording your voice while recording the game video.

Use a headset with a microphone in front of your mouth to minimize background noise. Do some tests to find the optimal recording volume where you can clearly hear your voice but not hear mouse clicks!

Use Free Sound Recorder to record your voice on a separate track
sound-recorder.biz/freesoundrecorder.html

This has a global hotkey that starts recording while playing!

Use Audacity to remove noise (use the latest version, 1.3.12 beta as of now)
http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/

It is amazing! Your computer fan and other background noise just disappears.

Audacity does not have a global record hotkey

Fraps lets you record your voice from a microphone in the Movies tab
Check "Record external input"
But it does not create a separate audio track (it mixes into the main track).

Fraps uses the default Windows recording device. To choose another, use the Windows control panel to change the default recording device.

To record in Adobe Premiere CS5, follow these steps
help.adobe.com/en_US/premierepro/cs/using/WS1c9bc5c2e465a58a91cf0b1038518aef7-7f3ca.html

Edit video

Adobe Premiere CS5 is the best video editing tool
www.adobe.com/products/premiere/

Use premiere to add the video ender (see below) and apply transitions.

Step 2: Capture the video

High-definition

Use Fraps to record all videos at 30 frames per second in either
720p (1280 x 720)
1080p (1920 x 1080)
YouTube adds an "HD" suffix to distinguish these video as "high-definition"

1080p vs 720p

1080p is noticeably sharper than 720p.

See the difference
images.fromAnywhere.com/tgn/compare/youtube-1080p-to-720p/

Use 1080p if

Game supports it

Some games do not go up to 1920 x 1080

Hardware supports it

If the recorded video cannot maintain a steady 30 frames per second and is jerky, use 1280 x 720

Font is readable

If the font is hard to read after uploading to YouTube, increase the game font size (if you can) or use 1280 x 720

For more information, see
staffforums.stratics.com/showthread.php?t=70811

Step 3: Edit the video

Template projects

Create all videos in one of these Adobe Premiere CS5 template projects

See
tgnfile.com/templates/videos
720p
tgnfile.com/templates/videos/template-720p.prproj

1080p
tgnfile.com/templates/videos/template-1080p.prproj

Content

"A video on every wiki page" is our motto.

Each video should visualize a concept or answer a question.

For example
leagueoflegends-wiki.com/faq/what-is-a-moba

Length

"10-60 seconds" is the ideal video length.

Focus on one topic, then add the videos to a wiki page.

For example
divinesouls-wiki.com/combos/fighter-combos

Long videos

Some videos will be longer than a minute, like a collection or a full review

Collection example
divinesouls-wiki.com/combos

Full review example
youtube.com/user/MMOHut#p/search/7/qNxM8qKP-Ew

Pre-roll / Post-roll

Do not create a custom pre-roll or post-roll.

We know you can make a much cooler ender, but we want people to say, "Oh! I've seen that before on that other video!" Brand recognition and one consistent ender will help all of our videos become more popular over time.

Use the enders in the template projects above, replacing the last text with the correct game and company name.

For example
Divine Souls (c) Outspark

Step 4: Publish the video

Upload to YouTube

Upload all videos to the appropriate TGN channel.

See all TGN channels
thegamenet.com/videos

Contact TGN for the YouTube username / password
info@thegamenet.com

Consistent title, description and tags

Title

Start every title with "TGN"

For example
TGN Fighter Combo 9: Earthquake - Divine Souls

Description

Start every description with a URL and an em dash (Alt+0151)

For example
http://www.divinesouls-wiki.com â€” Elbow from the sky, the 9th Fighter combo "Earthquake" in Divine Souls.

Tags

Start all tags with "tgn thegamenet"

For example
tgn thegamenet "divine souls" fighter combo

Why do this?

All this helps YouTube recommend other TGN videos in the right sidebar.

See the result
youtube.com/watch?v=HX4Jxu10zF0

Transcripts

If there is text in the video, create transcripts on TGN Tube.

For example
videoreadr.com/read/tgn-what-is-a-moba-league-of-legends/

Black Bars

If your video has black bars on YouTube, you didn't record at one of these two resolutions
1280 x 720
1920 x 1080
If you record at a different resolution, like 1680 x 1050, YouTube scales down to 1280 x 720 and adds black bars as padding if the aspect ratio is different.
1280 / 720 = 1.7778
