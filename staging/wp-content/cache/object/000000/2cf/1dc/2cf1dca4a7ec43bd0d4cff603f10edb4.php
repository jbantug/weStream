<strong>How Can I Partner with Two Networks at the Same Time?</strong>

I founded any TV as a new Network that does *not* partner your YouTube channel. That is why you don't need to unpartner from your current Network to partner with any TV.

You can partner with both at the same time.
&nbsp;

<strong>Is any TV legit?</strong>

any TV is like Amazon.com. You can add Amazon "Buy Now" links beneath your YouTube videos and get paid if someone clicks the link and buys the product. This *is* allowed by YouTube. I know, because YouTube told us directly when I was President of TGN.

The any TV "Play Now" links work the same way as Amazon. You get paid whenever someone clicks your link and starts playing the game. You do not get paid just for clicks.

Other pay-per-click sites, like www.adf.ly, are not allowed by YouTube. In fact, YouTube shuts channels down for using adf.ly links. If you are using them and haven't been shut down, don't push your luck and delete them.

The same goes for using automated tools like www.tubetoolbox.com. I have seen channels get shut down just for using that tool. If you are using it and you haven't had any problems, you are just pushing your luck.

YouTube is completely against any kind of automation tools like tubetoolbox.com or click-spamming-for-money sites like adf.ly. Even though these tools can be used legitimately, they are so often abused, YouTube bans them.

But, YouTube completely supports legitimate promotions and product integration videos (they even have a checkbox for ""this video contains a product placement"").


Bottom Line

any TV is a new kind of Network that is open to all YouTubers across all Networks, just like Amazon.com. I, George Vanous, promise you this will grow very quickly, just like TGN grew very quickly under my leadership.

Get involved now and refer your friends to earn your lifetime 10% bonus! This is my way of saying, "Thank you" for promoting any TV. (But if you wait too long, there won't be anyone left to invite!)
