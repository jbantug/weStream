[title size="2"]Avada is Responsive &amp; Looks Great On All Screen Sizes[/title]
Avada can automatically adapt to many screen sizes thanks to its responsive capabilities. Try resizing your browser window to see the adaptation. Even better is that all of Avada's sliders are also fully responsive; Parallax Layer Slider, Revolution Slider, Awesome FlexSlider and our ThemeFusion Slider. All sliders include touch swipe functionality for tablets and smartphones. Not only is it responsive but it also keeps the clean, modern design all the way down to smaller screen sizes such as iPhones. Every element has been tweaked for different screen sizes to make sure it looks great no matter what the device. Now people can easily browse your site using smartphones, tablets, laptops or desktop computers.";s:10:"post_title";s:17:"Responsive Design";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:18:"lots-of-shortcodes";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2012-07-31 04:45:22";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2012-07-31 04:45:22";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:80;s:4:"guid";s:42:"http://theme-fusion.com/avada/?page_id=136";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
