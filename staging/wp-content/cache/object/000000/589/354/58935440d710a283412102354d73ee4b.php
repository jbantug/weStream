[title size="2"]Why Choose Avada?[/title]
The FlexSlider can easily be used as the large slider at the top of the page, or you can use it as a shortcode inside page content. For the large slider at the top of the page, users can use the WooSlider plugin, or use it via Theme Options. Avada 2.0 now has it integrated into our Theme Options for use with captions.
