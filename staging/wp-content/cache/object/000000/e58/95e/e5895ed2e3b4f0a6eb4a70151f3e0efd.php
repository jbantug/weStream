Everybody starts at the same payout rates per game per country, and publishers carefully track how the people you refer behave. If your way of promoting gets higher quality conversions, the publishers tell us and pay more for your traffic.

People who are genuinely interested to try the offer and who become "hooked" after watching your videos or live streams. Involve your audience, challenge them, help them discover what is awesome and addictive and why you love it!

Bottom line: Create compelling content that is going to make viewers want the product, and keep wanting it every day.
