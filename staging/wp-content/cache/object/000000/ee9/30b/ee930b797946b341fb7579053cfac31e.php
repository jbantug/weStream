Hello [insert_your_name],

I am messaging you today to invite you to come and check out our awesome recommendation revenue network, which was created by the ex-President of TGN: George Vanous, after he sold TGN to BroadbandTV in Oct, 2012.

You can earn a new recommendation revenue stream in addition to your YouTube ad revenue by adding a play now link - like this one: http://play.any.tv/SHAGQ - beneath your videos. This is exactly like Amazon.com buy now links, except instead of selling products, you are telling your fans where to go to play free-to-play games and they don't need to buy anything.

You earn about $1 per person who signs up to play a game like League of Legends or Star Wars: The Old Republic through your play now links. And every play now link is unique and custom-generated for you by our dashboard.

For more information, see this video:

Thank you for your time and keep doing what you are doing!

any.TV believes in you.
