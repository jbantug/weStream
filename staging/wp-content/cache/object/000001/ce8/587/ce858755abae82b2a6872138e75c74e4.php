Why?

We want our partners to use the dashboard, not just promote it to others. This is called "eating your own steak" :-)

The easiest way to get a conversion is to make a video about any offer that interests you from <a href="http://www.dashboard.tm/">www.dashboard.tm</a> by clicking your own Play Now link. As long as you promote the offer, it is okay to click your own link.

Note: If you do not get a conversion one month, your Refer-a-Friend revenue carries over to the next month and will be paid out as soon as you have a month with at least one conversion.";s:10:"post_title";s:61:"Can I just earn Refer-a-Friend revenue? - Yes, but only if...";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:54:"can-i-just-earn-refer-a-friend-revenue-yes-but-only-if";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2013-06-10 10:11:18";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2013-06-10 18:11:18";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:50:"http://www.any.tv/?post_type=avada_faq&#038;p=5075";s:10:"menu_order";i:9;s:9:"post_type";s:9:"avada_faq";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
