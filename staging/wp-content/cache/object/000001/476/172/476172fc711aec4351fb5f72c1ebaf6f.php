Why?

Think of this from the publisher's perspective: They are paying for sign-ups to their games with the expectation that each sign-up genuinely wants to play the game, not enter your giveaway.

But contests featuring the game are encouraged!

Challenge people to play a game, such as: "How fast can you level up from 0 to 20? Click the Play Now link below to play! Post a video response proving your achievement."
